## Introduction

Communities are an integral part of your journey in tech. They help you grow at lightning-fast speed while not burning out and having fun!

One of my friends, [Mikal](https://twitter.com/Goobric) emphasizes **"commUNITY"**

Here are a few benefits to commUNITY:

- Ever stuck on a bug? Unable to solve it alone. What do you think about a hundred people alongside you, each trying to help you fix the error by guiding you 🔥

- Do you need mentorship? Communities have a lot of experienced and skilled people with a lot of will to help others and grow together 😍

- Communities give you a lot of exposure, new people, workshops, events, hangouts, projects, and a lot more! I learnt about Open Source, Web3, APIs and a lot more! ⚡

- You can be much more accountable. Human psychology gets work done if you've shared you are doing it. If used efficiently, this will help you out a ton 🤓

- "Together, we can grow more", With everyone's 2 cents, it is easy to load up thousands! 🤝

- Communities come with opportunities. I have never seen a month where I haven't met someone who hasn't gained so much from communities and their opportunities 🤩

- Everybody needs hangouts. Sometimes you are tired and need someone to talk with for a while. Community Hangouts are where a group of people at a community chit-chat and have fun in a call! ✌️

- Grow your network: the only people I have connected with yet are from communities. I am more than content with my network! ✨

Most importantly, each community is a unique experience. A community is not only a community but also a family 😉

## Communities

Let us now come forward to some of the extraordinary communities that exist.

### Open Source

![GitHub is not just a platform is a community of 83 million developers building software](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654495207997/nc3dajyno.png align="center")

Open Source is the biggest community out there. There is a spot for everyone out there! Open Source is the iron heart of software and will always be. Contributing to Open Source brings experience, soft skills, opportunities, knowledge and a feeling of impact.

A common myth is that Open Source is for experienced developers. No! Open Source is not only about code but also collaboration and adding value. Every year numerous no-code contributors join Open Source.
